.SS Overview
The hsh utility executes commands from the command line string, standard input, or a specified file. It supports both interactive and non-interactive modes, allowing commands to be entered directly into the running shell or stored in a file for execution.
.sp 1
There are three types of commands that can be interpreted by the shell: system calls, built-in commands, or commands with specified paths.
If the command name does not match a built-in and its path is not specified, it will be searched for in all directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
